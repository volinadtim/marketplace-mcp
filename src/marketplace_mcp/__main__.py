"""Console entrypoint: ``python -m marketplace_mcp``.

Three transports: stdio for a client that spawns the process itself, and two
long-lived HTTP ones for a remote agent — streamable HTTP at /mcp, which is what
clients use now, and the deprecated event stream at /sse. Either way the same
port serves ``/metrics``, so one published port covers both the protocol and
scraping.
