"""Parse the wishlists page and the membership modal.

Two sources answering different halves of one question: the wishlists page names
every list with its id and count, while the ``favoritesListsSelect`` modal says
which of them a given product is in. Neither is complete on its own — the modal
drops the id of any list the product is already in.

Ozon's «Подборки» are *not* these lists: they live on ``/selections/list``, are
not created by the same action, and are not covered here.
