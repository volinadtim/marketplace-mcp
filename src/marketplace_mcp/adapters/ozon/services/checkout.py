"""Checkout services: read the order being formed and adjust its options.

Reachable only on a session whose OzonID login is intact — that realm guards
checkout and does not survive a storageState snapshot, which is why the browser
runs on a persistent profile.

Every option Ozon exposes here is applied the way the site does it: a refresh of
the checkout page carrying one query parameter. Configuring several options is
therefore several refreshes, and the last response is the final state.

Placing an order spends real money, so it sits behind its own flag
