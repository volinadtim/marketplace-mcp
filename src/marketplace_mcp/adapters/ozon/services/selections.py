"""«Подборки» — curated, publishable lists of products.

A separate entity from wishlists, with its own identifiers and its own rules:

- a selection is addressed by a uuid, and reading one also needs its owner id,
  which only the list's link carries;
- its products come from favorites — Ozon's own picker offers nothing else, so a
  product has to be favorited before it can be put in a selection;
- one call sets the whole product list rather than appending to it, which is
  also how a product is taken out;
- it can be published to the account's public profile, and publishing goes
  through moderation, so the state right after is "На модерации" and not "live".

All of it is driven by one action, ``submitSelectionFormWeb``, told apart by its
``placement``: creating, editing the text and setting the products are three
different placements of the same call, and passing the wrong one silently
creates a second selection instead of changing the first.
