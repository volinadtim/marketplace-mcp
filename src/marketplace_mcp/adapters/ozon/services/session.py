"""Session state and interactive re-login.

A signed-out session is indistinguishable from an empty account: orders come
back empty, balances read as None, nothing explains why. So the state is
reportable, a signed-out session raises rather than answers, and recovery is
available as tools — Ozon sends a one-time code out of band, so it takes two
calls with a person in between.
