"""Closed sets of values, as enums rather than as strings.

These are the values a caller can be handed and has to branch on. As plain
strings they had to be compared against literals spelled out at each site — and
one of them, ``PayAfterReceipt.scope``, decides how much money is charged today.
``StrEnum`` keeps them readable in JSON while making the set itself checkable.
