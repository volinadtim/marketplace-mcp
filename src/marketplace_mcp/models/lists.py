    it needs ``owner_id`` alongside the uuid.

    ``status`` is Ozon's own wording for where the selection stands — "Личная
    подборка" while it is private, "N сохранений" once public, "На модерации"
    while it is being reviewed — because publishing is not instant. It is not a
    substitute for ``public``: a selection under review reads "На модерации"
    whichever way its visibility is set, so the two are reported separately.

    ``description`` and ``public`` are only known when the selection is read on
    its own (``get_selection``); listing them all does not carry either.
