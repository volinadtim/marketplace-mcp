"""Cart read + (gated) mutation services.

Two different mechanisms, both captured live:

- quantity (and removal, at quantity 0) is an ``_action`` endpoint,
  ``POST _action/v2/addToCart`` with ``[{"id": <int>, "quantity": N}]``;
- the tick next to each item is a page command posted to the cart's own JSON
  URL, ``{"name": "selectItems", "params": "{...}"}``.

The ticks matter more than they look: they are what composes an order. Ozon
builds the checkout from the selected items, so nothing can be ordered until
something is ticked.
