"""Argument types shared by the tools, described for the caller.

An agent sees a tool's JSON schema and its description, nothing else — so what
an argument accepts belongs in the schema, next to the argument. Naming the
choices as ``Literal`` puts them there as an enum, and the descriptions here are
written for a caller that has no other documentation.
