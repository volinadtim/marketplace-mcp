"""Reading and writing the money amounts Ozon puts in its widgets.

Ozon states amounts two ways — rendered for people ("2 152 ₽", "415,64 ₽",
with thin and non-breaking spaces as the thousands separator) and as an integer
number of kopecks in action parameters. Anything that has to compare or subtract
them goes through kopecks, because the rendered form is not arithmetic.
