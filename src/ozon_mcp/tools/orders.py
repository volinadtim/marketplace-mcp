    wholly older. The cost is the depth, not the width — a recent fortnight comes
    back in under a second, a month two years back takes tens of seconds. The
    dates are status dates (received / cancelled), the only ones the archive
    prints, so an order placed on 30 June and received on 2 July lands in July.

    parcel with it was «Получен», false when every one was «Отменён», null when
    it was not found in the orders scanned.
    The answer says how far it looked — `scanned_orders`, `scanned_back_to`,
    `complete` and the `unresolved` skus. It is bounded because each order costs
    a request and a full sweep of an old account takes minutes.
    «Отменён» is not the end of it: `provisional` lists items seen only as
    cancelled, because an older order may have been received — carry them on with
    `unresolved` when you continue.
    To keep looking, call again with skus=<unresolved + provisional> and
    scan_before=<scanned_back_to>, then merge by sku, preferring received. Do not
    simply raise scan_orders: that re-reads what was already covered. And do not
    repeat the query with scan_before alone — the items it already placed live in
    newer orders, so they would come back unresolved.
    Budget: with a query the first call takes about 40 s (the purchase index
    alone is ~20 s) and each continuation of 150 orders about 30 s. If your
    client's timeout is shorter, call purchases() for the skus first and then
    bought_items(skus=…) in chunks.
    Never report an unresolved sku as "not bought": it means nobody looked that
    far back.
