"""A widget name that is a prefix of another must not be confused with it.

A product card carries both ``webPrice`` and ``webPriceDecreasedCompact``, and
matching by prefix returned whichever Ozon happened to serve first — so the same
card answered with its price or with «Стало дешевле», at random. That is how
find_cheaper came to report "nothing is cheaper" for a product it had failed to
price.
