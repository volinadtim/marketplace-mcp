"""An item's outcome belongs to its parcel, not to its order.

Refusing something at the pickup point cancels that parcel while the rest of the
order is received, so one order holds «Получен» and «Отменён» at once. Flattening
the parcels lost it, and «Купленные товары» — which lists everything ever ordered
and states no status — then read as "bought" for items nobody took home.
